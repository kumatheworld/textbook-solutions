\begin{customthm}{I.4.18}
  Assume $y$ is a set such that $y\in y$ and let $x=\{y\}$. This $x$ can be expressed as $x=\{z\in y:z=y\}$ and hence it exists by Comprehension. Now we apply Foundation to $x$, which states that there is no $z$ such that $z=y\wedge z\in y$. That contradicts the assumption $y\in y$. Thus $y\not\in y$ holds for any set $y$.
\end{customthm}

\begin{customthm}{I.6.23}
  Let $X$ be a non-empty subset of $(\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N},R)$. Let $x=\min(\dom(X))$ and $y=\min\{v\in\mathbb{N}:(x,v)\in X\}$. Then $(x,y)$ is an $R$-minimal element. $X$ has at most $y$ minimal elements other than $(x,y)$ because $X_v=\{(u,v)\in X\}$ for each $v<y$ has at most 1 minimal element and $(u,v)\in X$ such that $y\leq v$ and $(u,v)\neq(x,y)$ cannot be minimal since $(x,y)<(u,v)$ holds. Hence $X$ has only finitely many $R$-minimal elements. For each $k\in\mathbb{N}$, we have a subset $\{(x,y)\in\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}:x+y+1=k\}$ of size $k$, every element of which is an $R$-minimal element.
\end{customthm}

\begin{customthm}{I.6.26}
  $\in$ totally orders $3=\{0,1,2\}$ because $0\in 1=\{0\}$, $0\in 2=\{0,1\}$ and $1\in 2=\{0,1\}$ hold. Moreover, it is strict because none of $0\in 0$, $1\in 1$ or $2\in 2$ holds. Indeed, $0\not\in 0=\emptyset$ is obvious. $1\in 1$ would imply $1=0$, but we know $0\in 1\setminus0$. $2\in 2$ would imply either $2=0$ or $2=1$, both of which case are contradictory. Now it is clear that $\in$ well-orders $3$ because it is a strict total order and $3$ is finite.
\end{customthm}

\begin{customthm}{I.6.29}
  Assume there are distinct sets $x,y$ such that $S(x)=S(y)$. Since $x\in S(x)$, we get $x\in y$ from $x\in S(y)$ and $x\neq y$. We get $y\in x$ as well, from which we conclude that the set $\{x,y\}$ has no $\in$-minimal element. Thus $S$ is injective on $V$.
\end{customthm}

\begin{customthm}{I.7.2}
  Let $t$ be a non-empty transitive set. By Foundation, there is $x\in t$ with $x\cap t=\emptyset$. Since $t$ is transitive, $x\subseteq t$ holds and we get $x=\emptyset$ from $x\cap t=\emptyset$. Now assume $t$ has at least 1 element other than $\emptyset$. By applying Foundation to $t\setminus\{\emptyset\}$, we get $y\in t$ such that $y\neq\emptyset\wedge y\cap(t\setminus\{\emptyset\})=\emptyset$. From $y\subseteq t$ (transitivity) and $y\cap(t\setminus\{\emptyset\})=\emptyset$ we get $y\subseteq\{\emptyset\}$, which means nothing but $y=\{\emptyset\}$ since $y$ is non-empty. Now the statements in the exercise are clear.
\end{customthm}

\begin{customthm}{I.7.25}
  Any ordinal is transitive and satisfies trichotomy by definition. Conversely, under Foundation, we prove that any transitive set whose $\in$ satisfies trichotomy also satisfies irreflexivity and transitivity. Irreflexivity is obvious from Exercise I.4.18. To prove transitivity, let $z$ be a transitive set, $w,x,y\in z$ and $w\in x\in y$. If $(z,\in)$ satisfies trichotomy, either of $w\in y$, $w=y$ or $y\in w$ holds. If $w=y$, then $y\in x\in y$ would hold, producing a set $\{x,y\}$ which does not have an $\in$-minimal element, contradicting Foundation. $y\in w$ would produce a contradictory set $\{w,x,y\}$ as well. Thus $w\in y$ holds, which proves transitivity. Hence $z$ is totally ordered by $\in$ and turns out to be an ordinal by Lemma I.7.2.
\end{customthm}

\begin{customthm}{I.7.26}
  Any ordinal is a transitive set by definition and all its elements are transitive because $\in$ on it is a transitive relation by definition. We now assume Foundation to prove the converse. Let $z$ be a transitive set whose elements are all transitive sets and let $\alpha$ be the least ordinal such that $\alpha\not\in z$. Note that such $\alpha$ exists by Theorem I.7.12 and Theorem I.9.3. Since any $\beta\in\alpha$ is an ordinal less than $\alpha$, we have $\beta\in z$ and thus $\alpha\subseteq z$ holds. Assume $\alpha\subsetneq z$ and let $y$ be an $\in$-minimal element of $z\setminus\alpha$. Let $x\in y$. Since $z$ is a transitive set, we have $x\in z$. On the other hand, $x\not\in z\setminus\alpha$ holds since otherwise it would contradict the minimality of $y$. Thus we get $x\in\alpha$, which proves $y\subseteq\alpha$. Now from Theorem I.7.13, $y$ turns out to be an ordinal since it is a transitive set of ordinals. Then either of $y\in\alpha$ or $y=\alpha$ holds from $y\subseteq\alpha$, the first one of which is not the case due to $y\in z\setminus\alpha$. Therefore $y=\alpha$ holds and we get $\alpha\in z$, but that contradicts the definition of $\alpha$. Thus our assumption $\alpha\subsetneq z$ is not correct and hence we conclude $\alpha=z$, which proves that $z$ is an ordinal.
\end{customthm}

\begin{customthm}{I.7.27}
  Let $A,B$ be finite sets, $f:A\rightarrow m$ and $g:B\rightarrow n$ be bijections where $m$ and $n$ are natural numbers. See lemma I.16.5 for existence of such natural numbers. Now we prove $A\cup B\preccurlyeq m+n$ and $A\times B\approx m\cdot n$.

  To show $A\cup B\preccurlyeq m+n$, we consider a function $f\cup g:A\cup B\rightarrow m\times\{0\}\cup n\times\{1\}$ defined by $f\cup g(x)=(f(x),0)$ if $x\in A$ and $f\cup g(x)=(g(x),1)$ otherwise. Since $f$ and $g$ are injective, $f\cup g$ is also injective. Therefore we get $A\cup B\preccurlyeq m\times\{0\}\cup n\times\{1\}\approx m+n$. One can show the finiteness of $m+n$ by induction on $n$, where facts such as $m+S(n)\approx S(m+n)$ and that $S(n)$ is finite whenever $n$ is finite will be used.

  Likewise, for $A\times B\approx m\cdot n$, consider a function $f\times g:A\times B\rightarrow m\times n$ defined by $f\times g(x,y)=(f(x),g(y))$, which is bijective since $f$ and $g$ are bijective. One can show the finiteness of $m\times n$ by induction on $n$, where facts such as $m\times S(n)\approx m\times n+m$ and the closure property of $+$ on $\omega$ which is shown above will be used.

  To prove the existence of $\mathcal{P}(A)$, we first show the existence of $\mathcal{P}(m)$ by induction on $m$. It is obvious that $\mathcal{P}(\emptyset)=\{\emptyset\}=1$ exists. Now let us assume that $\mathcal{P}(m)$ exists and consider a function $h:2\times\mathcal{P}(m)\rightarrow\mathcal{P}(S(m))$ defined by $h(0,S)=S$ and $h(1,S)=S\cup\{m\}$. Since this $h$ is a bijection, we obtain $\mathcal{P}(S(m))$ by Replacement. Therefore $\mathcal{P}(m)$ exists for each $m\in\omega$. Now we can easily get $\mathcal{P}(A)=\{\{f(l):l\in S\}:S\in\mathcal{P}(m)\}$ by Replacement.
\end{customthm}

\begin{customthm}{I.9.6}
  Assume Lemma I.9.5(2). For Infinity, we consider the class of natural numbers $A$ and a relation $R$ defined by $xRy\leftrightarrow x=S(y)$. Since $R$ is set-like on $A$, $R^*$ is set-like too by the assumption. Then $\pred_{R^*}(0)=\{x\in A:x=S(S(\cdots (S(0))))\}=A$ turns out to be a set.
\end{customthm}

\begin{customthm}{I.9.8}
  If $R$ is cyclic on $A$, let $a_0,a_1,\ldots,a_{n-1},a_0$ be a cycle and consider $S=\{a_i:i<n\}$ . Since $S$ is a non-empty subset of $A$ which does not have an $R$-minimal element, $R$ is not well-founded on $A$. Hence any well-founded relation is acyclic. Now we consider the converse when the underlying set is finite. If $R$ is not well-founded on a finite set $A$, there is a non-empty $S\subseteq A$ which does not have an $R$-minimal element. Then $S$ has a cycle because otherwise we would have an infinite sequence of distinct elements in $S$, which cannot happen since $A$ is finite. Thus any acyclic relation on a finite set is well-founded on that set.
\end{customthm}

\begin{customthm}{I.9.27}
  Since $\mathbb{R}\subseteq R(\omega)$, $\mathbb{R}\in R(\omega+1)\subseteq WF$ holds and we have $\rank(\mathbb{R})=\sup\{\rank(x)+1:x\in\mathbb{R}\}=\omega+1$. Since the Lebesgue measure $\mu$ is a function with $\{\emptyset\}\subsetneq\dom(\mu)\subseteq\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R})$ and $\ran(\mu)\subseteq\mathbb{R}$, each element of $\mu$ is a pair $\langle x,y\rangle$ with $\rank(x)=\omega+1$ and $\rank(y)=\omega$. Thus from Lemma I.9.26 (2), each $\langle x,y\rangle\in\mu$ has rank $\omega+3$ and we get $\rank(\mu)=\omega+4$.
\end{customthm}

\begin{customthm}{I.9.39}
  To prove the 'if' part, assume that $R^*$ totally orders $A$. Let $x,y\in A$ be distinct elements. We can assume $xR^*y$ and let $xRx_1R\cdots Rx_nRy$ without loss of generality. Then by the definition of $\rank$, we have $\rank(x)<\rank(x_1)<\cdots\rank(x_n)<\rank(y)$. Thus $\rank$ is injective. To prove the 'only if' part, assume $\rank$ is injective. Let $x,y\in A$ be distinct elements and assume WLOG that $\rank(x)<\rank(y)$. By Lemma I.9.16, there is an $a\in A$ such that $aR^*y$ and $\rank(a)=\rank(x)$. Since $\rank$ is injective, this $a$ is nothing but $x$ and we get $xR^*y$. Thus $R^*$ totally orders $A$.
\end{customthm}

\begin{customthm}{I.9.40}
  Let $R_1\subseteq R_2$ are both well-founded and set-like on $A$. Then $\rank_{A,R_1}(y)\leq\rank_{A,R_2}(y)$ obviously holds for all $y\in A$ because we have $\pred_{A,R_1}\subseteq\pred_{A,R_2}$. We next show that $\rank_{A,R_1^*}(y)\leq\rank_{A,R_1}(y)$ holds for all $y\in A$. Note that $R_1^*$ is also set-like and well-founded on $A$ (see Lemma I.9.5 and Lemma I.9.15). Now let $xR_1^*y$ and consider a path $xR_1x_1R_1\cdots R_1x_nR_1y$. We have $\rank_{A,R_1}(x)+1<\rank_{A,R_1}(x_1)+1<\cdots<\rank_{A,R_1}(x_n)+1\leq\rank_{A,R_1}(y)$ and thus $\rank_{A,R_1^*}(y)\leq\rank_{A,R_1}(y)$ holds. Now if $R_1\subseteq R_2\subseteq R_1^*$, we will have $\rank_{A,R_1}(y)\leq\rank_{A,R_2}(y)\leq\rank_{A,R_1^*}(y)\leq\rank_{A,R_1}(y)$ for all $y\in A$, which says $\rank_{A,R_1}(y)=\rank_{A,R_2}(y)=\rank_{A,R_1^*}(y)$.
\end{customthm}

\begin{customthm}{I.9.41}
  We first show that $\rank_{A,R}(y)=\{\rank_{A,R}(x):x\in y\downarrow\}$ for all $y\in A$. For any $\alpha<\rank_{A,R}(y)$, there is an $x\in A$ such that $xR^*y\wedge\rank_{A,R}(x)=\alpha$ by Lemma I.9.16. Since $R$ is transitive now, $xR^*y$ simply means $xRy$, which implies such an $x$ satisfies $x\in y\downarrow$. Therefore $\rank_{A,R}(y)\subseteq\{\rank_{A,R}(x):x\in y\downarrow\}$ holds. The opposite inclusion is obvious since $\rank_{A,R}(x)<\rank_{A,R}(y)$ holds whenever $xRy$. Thus we get $\rank_{A,R}(y)=\{\rank_{A,R}(x):x\in y\downarrow\}$. Now let $X=\{a\in A:\mos_{A,R}(a)\neq\rank_{A,R}(a)\}$, assume $X$ is non-empty and let $y\in X$ be an $R$-minimal element. By the minimality of $y$ and what we have proved above, we get $\mos_{A,R}(y)=\{\mos_{A,R}(x):x\in y\downarrow\}=\{\rank_{A,R}(x):x\in y\downarrow\}=\rank(y)$, which contradicts $y\not\in X$. Thus $X$ is empty and we get $\mos_{A,R}(a)=\rank_{A,R}(a)$ for all $a\in A$.
\end{customthm}

\begin{customthm}{I.9.42}
  Since $R$ is well-founded and is a transitive relation, we have $\mos_{A,R}(a)=\rank_{A,R}(a)$ for all $a\in A$ from Exercise I.9.41. Moreover, $R$ is extensional on $A$, which means $\mos_{A,R}$ is an isomorphism from $(A,R)$ to an ordinal $(\mos"A,\in)$ by Lemma I.9.35. This $(\mos"A,\in)$ is an ordinal since it is a transitive set of ordinals. Then by Theorem I.8.2, we have $\mos"A=\type(A;R)$ and thus $\mos_{A,R}$ and $\rank_{A,R}$ are both identical to the isomorphism.
